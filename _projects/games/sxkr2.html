    This game project was created during my sophomore year. My team consisted of 4 total members. One producer, one technical
    director, one designer, and one product manager. I was the technical director and the lead graphics programmer for this
    project. My involvement in this project consisted of making the graphics architecture, debugging for hard bugs to find,
    increasing the performance of our game, and integrating game engines.
