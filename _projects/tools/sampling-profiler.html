<h2>Sampling Profiler</h2>

<p>
    This started off being a small project for one of my classes at DigiPen. Now, this project has turned into a useful sampling
    profiler. The profiler is a small tool that I wrote in C++ CLI and mixes with C# dlls. This is more of a personal project
    to have fun and make something useful.
